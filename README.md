## Goals
- Design an inexpensive tabletop loom for
  - tablet weaving 
  - [TODO] rigid heddle weaving
  - [TODO] others?
  
## Background 
Looms are expensive, large, and generally single-purpose. I want to start weaving, but don't want to shell out $1,000+ just to see whether I like it or not. This loom fixes all these problems. 

### Modular
The frame has holes for and arbitrary number of attachments. Anything can be attached to it using connectors modeled after the beam/pin/bracket system that is included in this design. 

### 3D Printable
All parts are designed to be 3D printed with no support. [TODO] Currently the frame can only be printed on the CR-10 (or larger) printer. This will be fixed very soon. 

### Upgradable
Once v1 is achieved, I will make backward compatibility a goal. Further, since this system is modular, upgrades can be made simply and quickly to achieve any goal. 

### Miniature
Perhaps due to the limited size of 3D printers, or in an effort to maintain its "table top loom" classification, this loom is bigger than a breadbox, but smaller than a microwave.
